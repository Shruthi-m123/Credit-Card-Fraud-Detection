# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a significant issue in financial transactions. This project aims to build a **Credit Card Fraud Detection** system using **Machine Learning** techniques to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.



## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model Used:** Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Neural Networks
- **Jupyter Notebook** / Google Colab for experimentation

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/creditcard-fraud-detection.git
   cd creditcard-fraud-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 🔍 Model Training & Evaluation
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
   - Feature scaling and normalization
   - Splitting data into training & testing sets
   
2. **Model Training:**
   - Train multiple models and compare their performance
   - Tune hyperparameters for optimal accuracy
   
3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve
   
📊 **Results:** The best model achieves an accuracy of `95%` on the test dataset.


## 🎯 Future Enhancements
- Deploy as a real-time fraud detection system 🌐
- Implement deep learning techniques 🧠
- Integrate with banking APIs for live monitoring ⚡
